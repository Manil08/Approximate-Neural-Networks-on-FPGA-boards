# Approximate Neural Networks on FPGA boards
Course project for ECN-343 Embedded System Design in 3rd year, IIT Roorkee in which we employed ML/DL techniques to extract weights from a trained ML model and executed an efficient Verilog code functioning as a multilayered CNN using lookup tables for image detection and reinforced it on Basys3 FPGA board.
